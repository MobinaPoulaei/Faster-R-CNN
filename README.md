# Faster R-CNN Implementation
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing the Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) for object detection tasks. 

# Introduction
Faster R-CNN is a popular deep learning-based approach for object detection that integrates region proposal networks (RPN) with fast R-CNN. This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to implementing Faster R-CNN from scratch, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# Model Architecture
The Faster R-CNN architecture consists of:

- A feature extraction network (in this notebook ResNet)
- Region Proposal Network (RPN)
- RoI Pooling
- Classification and Regression Heads

# Results
The notebook includes sections to visualize the results of the object detection model, displaying images with predicted bounding boxes and class labels.
